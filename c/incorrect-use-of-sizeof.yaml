      The code calls sizeof() on a malloced pointer type, which always
      returns the wordsize/8. This can produce an unexpected result if the
      programmer intended to determine how much memory has been allocated.
      The use of sizeof() on a pointer can sometimes generate useful
      information. An obvious case is to find out the wordsize on a
      platform. More often than not, the appearance of sizeof(pointer)
      indicates a bug.
