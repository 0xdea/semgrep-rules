      The strncat() function is intended to be a safe alternative to the
      strcat() function.
      However, strncat() is nearly as dangerous as strcat(), in that it's
      quite easy to misuse. Specifically, the size parameter can be
      confusing, as it indicates the amount of space left in the buffer.
      The first common mistake application developers make is supplying the
      size of the entire buffer instead of the size remaining in the
      buffer.
      A more subtle mistake can be made. The size parameter needs to be the
      amount of space left in the buffer less one; otherwise, the NUL byte
      is written one byte past the end of the buffer.
