      The strncat() function is nearly as dangerous as strcat(), in that it's
      quite easy to misuse. The first common mistake is supplying the size of 
      the entire buffer instead of the size remaining in the buffer. A more 
      subtle mistake can be made: the size parameter needs to be the amount of
      space left in the buffer less one; otherwise, the NUL byte is written 
      one byte past the end of the buffer.
