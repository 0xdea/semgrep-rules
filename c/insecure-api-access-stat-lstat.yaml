    message: >-
      The software checks the state of a resource before using that
      resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and
      the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can
      cause the software to perform invalid actions when the resource is in
      an unexpected state.
      This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence
      the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with
      shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in
      multithreaded programs.
