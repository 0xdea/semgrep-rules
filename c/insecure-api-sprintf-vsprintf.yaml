    message: >-
      The program invokes a potentially dangerous function that could
      introduce a vulnerability if it is used incorrectly, but the function
      can also be used safely.
      A buffer overflow condition exists when a program attempts to put
      more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when a program attempts to
      put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The
      simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer
      overflows, is the classic case in which the program copies the buffer
      without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the
      existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer
      is not considering even the most basic of security protections.
