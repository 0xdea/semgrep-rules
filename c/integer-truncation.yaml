      Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a
      smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.
      When a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive, the high order bits
      of the large value are lost in the conversion, potentially resulting
      in an unexpected value that is not equal to the original value. This
      value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or
      simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted
      and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may
      be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is
      rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has
      occurred.
