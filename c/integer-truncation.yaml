      # NOTE: the deep expression operator is necessary to catch some
      # matches because C/C++ integer promotions do not seem entirely
      # supported by Semgrep; this may generate false positives.
      # NOTE: some types (e.g., ptrs) and use cases (e.g., comparisons) 
      # are not covered.
    message: >-
      Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a 
      smaller size and data is lost in the conversion. The value cannot be 
      trusted and the application will be in an undefined state.
