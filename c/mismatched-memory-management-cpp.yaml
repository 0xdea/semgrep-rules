    message: >-
      The software attempts to return a memory resource to the system, but
      it calls a release function that is not compatible with the function
      that was originally used to allocate that resource.
      When the memory management functions are mismatched, the consequences
      may be as severe as code execution, memory corruption, or program
      crash. Consequences and ease of exploit will vary depending on the
      implementation of the routines and the object being managed.
      Due to inherent limitations of Semgrep, this rule might generate many
      false positives and should therefore be customized for your codebase.
