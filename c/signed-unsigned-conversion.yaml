    message: >-
      The software uses a signed primitive and performs a cast to an
      unsigned primitive, or uses an unsigned primitive and performs a cast
      to a signed primitive, which can produce an unexpected value if the
      value of the signed primitive cannot be represented using an unsigned
      primitive, or if the value of the unsigned primitive cannot be
      represented using a signed primitive.
      It is dangerous to rely on implicit casts between signed and unsigned
      numbers because the result can take on an unexpected value and
      violate assumptions made by the program.
      Often, functions will return negative values to indicate a failure.
      When the result of a function is to be used as a size parameter,
      using these negative return values can have unexpected results. For
      example, if negative size values are passed to the standard memory
      copy or allocation functions they will be implicitly cast to a large
      unsigned value. This may lead to an exploitable buffer overflow or
      underflow condition.
      Although less frequent an issue than signed-to-unsigned conversion,
      unsigned-to-signed conversion can be the perfect precursor to
      dangerous buffer underwrite conditions that allow attackers to move
      down the stack where they otherwise might not have access in a normal
      buffer overflow condition. Buffer underwrites occur frequently when
      large unsigned values are cast to signed values, and then used as
      indexes into a buffer or for pointer arithmetic.
