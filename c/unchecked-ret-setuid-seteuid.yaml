    message: >-
      The software does not check the return value from a method or
      function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and
      conditions.
      If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a
      value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could
      lead to a vulnerability, because the software is not in a state that
      the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function
      to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that
      privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue
      to operate with the higher privileges.
