      The snprintf() and vsnprintf() functions return the total length of
      the string they tried to create. Therefore, this return value can be
      larger than the size of the destination buffer. If it is used
      unsafely, e.g. as an index to write to the destination buffer, memory
      corruption might occur.
      Vulnerabilities such as this are not common because the return value
      is usually discarded. However, ignoring the result of these functions
      can result in data truncation.

    pattern-either:
      # =
      - pattern: $RET = snprintf(...)
      - pattern: $RET = vsnprintf(...)
      # +=
      - pattern: $RET += snprintf(...)
      - pattern: $RET += vsnprintf(...)
      # swprintf() and vswprintf() return a negative value if n or more 
      # widechars were requested to be written, thus behaving more safely
