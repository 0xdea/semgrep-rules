      The strlcpy() and strlcat() functions return the total length of the
      string they tried to create. For strlcpy() that means the length of
      the source string. For strlcat() that means the initial length of the
      destination string plus the length of of the source string.
      Therefore, this return value can be larger than the size of the
      destination buffer. If it is used unsafely, e.g. as an index to write
      to the destination buffer, memory corruption might occur.
      Vulnerabilities such as this are not common because the return value
      is usually discarded. However, ignoring the result of these functions
      can result in data truncation.
