      # NOTE: this rule only covers `free` called on stack-allocated
      # buffers (and possibly static variables); it does not cover 
      # other instances of `free` called on non-heap-allocated buffers; 
      # it also does not cover `alloca` and custom wrappers to `free`.
      # See also `raptor-mismatched-memory-management.yaml`.
    message: >-
      The software calls free() on a pointer to memory that has a short 
      lifetime and was not allocated using associated heap allocation 
      functions such as malloc(), calloc(), or realloc().
