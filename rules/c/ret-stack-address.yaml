      # NOTE: global variables declared outside functions and not explicitly
      # tagged as static are not supported.
      # NOTE: multiple pointer assignments and other ways to persist after
      # function returns (e.g., output parameter) are not covered.
    message: >-
      A function returns the address of a stack variable, which will cause
      unintended program behavior, typically in the form of a crash.
