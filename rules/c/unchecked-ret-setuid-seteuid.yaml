    message: >-
      The software does not check the return value from a method or
      function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and
      conditions. If the program calls a function to drop privileges but 
      does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were 
      successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with 
      the higher privileges.
