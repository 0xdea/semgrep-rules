    message: >-
      The snprintf() and vsnprintf() functions return the total length of
      the string they tried to create. Therefore, this return value can be
      larger than the size of the destination buffer. If it is used
      unsafely, e.g. as an index to write to the destination buffer, memory
      corruption might occur.
